# Kitchen Animation
This project showcases a custom-designed kitchen animation where all the elements, from furniture to appliances, are entirely built from scratch. Unlike standard animations that rely on pre-made assets, each object in the scene—such as the cabinets, counters, refrigerator, and even smaller details like the kettle and light switches—was individually created to provide a unique and cohesive environment. The animation features realistic interactions and dynamic elements, including a steam effect from a pan and a functional ceiling lamp.
